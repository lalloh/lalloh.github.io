Stay with us as we uncover these deceptive practices and explore how they can impact the trust and credibility that GitHub is built on.\nOrganization Membership # Let’s face the unfortunate truth, a user working in a well-known organization, such as Amazon or Google, will give us a more trustworthy feeling.\nBut the organization can be controlled by the user in the settings.\nThe verification symbol does not verify whether you work in that company but only proves that the company’s domain is verified.\nCongratulations on your new role at Facebook, Twitter, or any other company in the world, both verified and not!\nGitHub Achievements # You must have seen those shiny badges on the bottom of the profile, indicating some extraordinary activity on your GitHub account. Those achievements probably make you believe that the user has done something unusual to earn them, or, at least, has been active for long enough and written enough code to achieve them.\nUnfortunately, that section can be spoofed as well by threat actors. Using the GitHub API and simple automation, you can achieve all the badges within a few seconds or the golden level of them within an hour.\nUsing open source tools you can easily accomplish this. Here is an example that I used https://github.com/TukoG/spoofgit\nBefore and after a newly created profile achieve the badges via script in a couple of minutes\nContribution Activity # An active user who maintains his projects regularly, adding lots of code contributions gives you a trustworthy feeling. You would choose to use a project that has been daily updated for each day throughout a few years rather than using a project that was last updated 6 years ago, or one that has just been created.\nLuckily for us, there is no need to be active! All you should do is manipulate the commit date, and GitHub will present it as if you were active 24/7/365, including Saturdays and Holidays. A bad actor can customize the activity to look more realistic using the repo above.\nAdd Celebrity Contributors # Like Instagram or TikTok, GitHub has its own celebrities. Would it not be an incredible opportunity to work with Linus Torvalds or Samy Kamkar? Well, now you Can!\nAll you need to do is to add the desired contributor to the commit, and suddenly he becomes one! All you need to know is their github username.\nStats In Your Profile # When you create a repository on GitHub with the same name as your username, the README.md file within that repository will be displayed on your profile page. Some users use this space to show off various statistics about themselves.\nHowever, because anyone can write whatever they want in this file, there is no way to verify if the information or statistics displayed are accurate or true.\nConclusion # It took us less than 10 minutes to establish a credible-looking profile, one which will make headhunters and recruiters send you a connect invite on LinkedIn and will not raise any suspicions when posting a malicious code or asking to contribute to a popular open-source project.\nYou can try these techniques to see for yourself how easy it is to make a newly created GitHub and make it appear extraordinary.\nBut beware! the same way you can manipulate your GitHub information to make your profile more attractive can also be used by attackers, be cautious when handing maintainer access to your GitHub repository to strangers or using their code.\nReal World Examples of Attackers abusing this: # On July 25, 2024, MonoSwap (@monoswapio) was hacked.\nThe attack occurred because a MonoSwap developer, during a meeting with a fake venture capital entity the previous day, installed malware on their computer.\nThe phishing site was professionally designed and linked to a corresponding GitHub project where the hackers had artificially inflated the Watch, Fork, Contributors and Star metrics to make the fake project seem credible, making the developers to take the bait and eventually getting hacked.\n","date":"10 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-art-of-deception-on-github/","section":"","summary":"","title":"The Art Of Deception: How Attackers Manipulate Their GitHub Profiles to Deceive You","type":"posts"},{"content":"Cybercriminals are continuously evolving their tactics to exploit human behavior and trust. In one of the latest campaigns, attackers have weaponized fake CAPTCHA verification systems - tools typically used to verify a user’s legitimacy - to deliver malicious payloads.\nScam Analysis # This type of scam mainly comes in two forms:\nStealing Telegram accounts: Scammers lure users into providing their phone numbers, verification codes, and even two-step verification passwords to hijack their Telegram accounts.\nPlanting malware on users’ computers: This method, which has become more prevalent recently, will be the focus of this article.\nIntroduction # This campaign demonstrates an evolution from basic fake URL-based CAPTCHAs, seen in previous attacks, to a more sophisticated Telegram-based approach. The primary targets are cryptocurrency communities, where unsuspecting users are deceived into executing malicious scripts. This novel tactic highlights the rapid innovation and adaptability of cybercriminals in delivering malware.\nInfection Chain # The infection chain begins on the X platform (formerly Twitter), where attackers hijack legitimate threads, enticing users to join Telegram and channels groups under the guise of helpful discussions.\nOnce inside these channels, victims are prompted to complete a CAPTCHA verification using a bot designed to mimic “Safeguard” – a popular Telegram bot used for user validation. This process ultimately leads to the deployment of malware.\nHijacking Threads on X Platform # Threat actors exploit the X platform to infiltrate legitimate threads within the cryptocurrency community. By impersonating verified accounts or creating accounts with deceptive names and avatars that closely resemble the original poster, these actors strategically reply to popular posts from genuine crypto influencers. Their comments mimic the tone and content of the original thread, giving the appearance of helpful contributions to the discussion. Embedded within these replies are links directing users to Telegram groups and channels, setting the stage for the next phase of the attack.\nFake CAPTCHA via Telegram Mini Apps # When victims click on the Telegram link, they are presented with a post asking them to verify their identity using a fake Safeguard bot.\nClicking on the Tap to Verify button leads to fake Telegram bot with a handle resembling legitimate Safeguard variations\nBased on the victim’s device, the bot tailors its behavior:\nWindows Machines: By clicking verification, users are prompted with Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 instructions. Malicious code is secretly injected into their clipboard. If users paste this code into the Run dialog box, only partial content is visible, often starting with the word “Telegram,” obscuring the malicious intent.\nThe malicious command copied to the victim’s clipboard fetches a second-stage PowerShell script from the attacker’s Command and Control (C2) server and executes it.\nThe second-stage script sends a POST request to the C2 endpoint /sendNotification.php, containing the message “PowerShell script executed successfully.”\nFollowing this, the script downloads a ZIP archive, extracts its contents, and executes it. The extracted content is the Hijack Loader, which ends up loading the final payload – Lumma stealer.\nMac Machines: A command line is executed, delivering the Atomic Stealer malware.\nMobile Devices: When accessed via your mobile device, the scam will gradually gain access to your Telegram permissions. If detected in time, you should promptly navigate to Telegram’s Settings \u0026gt; Privacy and Security \u0026gt; Active Sessions and select Terminate all other sessions. Additionally, enable or modify your Two-Step Verification settings.\nIOCs # C2 # truecoders[.]cyou byteguard[.]cyou rainstorm[.]cyou codecrafters[.]cyou stem-clasping[.]kliplaxupoi[.]shop 92p1ka158tr2[.]com cloudewahsj[.]shop rabidcowse[.]shop noisycuttej[.]shop latechilderni[.]cyou meow182[.]com Hashes # 4bf9b71414d8b06a02687ebe4caf61ad558bb9c2 44f448e150266cde73808a2b4226314358d4a8f5 c17a7a559a47ab7e835eef840c55c490fdb93729 a3f3d7f6704ccb0d8ba4431ad5f5bfa088c93dbd f34e950726b4a4ba9efcb34e5317971e5a60866b a50f2940e15b68c60d688dd3ce725a6ccf3d0831 dd062bdcb616def4ff69f0e3816eb161fe0f537e ","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fake-safeguard-captchas-on-telegram-hacks-users/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Fake Safeguard Captchas on Telegram Hacks Users","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
