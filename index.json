In one of the latest campaigns, attackers have weaponized fake CAPTCHA verification systems - tools typically used to verify a user’s legitimacy - to deliver malicious payloads.\nScam Analysis # This type of scam mainly comes in two forms:\nStealing Telegram accounts: Scammers lure users into providing their phone numbers, verification codes, and even two-step verification passwords to hijack their Telegram accounts.\nPlanting malware on users’ computers: This method, which has become more prevalent recently, will be the focus of this article.\nIntroduction # This campaign demonstrates an evolution from basic fake URL-based CAPTCHAs, seen in previous attacks, to a more sophisticated Telegram-based approach. The primary targets are cryptocurrency communities, where unsuspecting users are deceived into executing malicious scripts. This novel tactic highlights the rapid innovation and adaptability of cybercriminals in delivering malware.\nInfection Chain # The infection chain begins on the X platform (formerly Twitter), where attackers hijack legitimate threads, enticing users to join Telegram and channels groups under the guise of helpful discussions.\nOnce inside these channels, victims are prompted to complete a CAPTCHA verification using a bot designed to mimic “Safeguard” – a popular Telegram bot used for user validation. This process ultimately leads to the deployment of malware.\nHijacking Threads on X Platform # Threat actors exploit the X platform to infiltrate legitimate threads within the cryptocurrency community. By impersonating verified accounts or creating accounts with deceptive names and avatars that closely resemble the original poster, these actors strategically reply to popular posts from genuine crypto influencers. Their comments mimic the tone and content of the original thread, giving the appearance of helpful contributions to the discussion. Embedded within these replies are links directing users to Telegram groups and channels, setting the stage for the next phase of the attack.\nFake CAPTCHA via Telegram Mini Apps # When victims click on the Telegram link, they are presented with a post asking them to verify their identity using a fake Safeguard bot.\nClicking on the Tap to Verify button leads to fake Telegram bot with a handle resembling legitimate Safeguard variations\nBased on the victim’s device, the bot tailors its behavior:\nWindows Machines: By clicking verification, users are prompted with Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 instructions. Malicious code is secretly injected into their clipboard. If users paste this code into the Run dialog box, only partial content is visible, often starting with the word “Telegram,” obscuring the malicious intent.\nThe malicious command copied to the victim’s clipboard fetches a second-stage PowerShell script from the attacker’s Command and Control (C2) server and executes it.\nThe second-stage script sends a POST request to the C2 endpoint /sendNotification.php, containing the message “PowerShell script executed successfully.”\nFollowing this, the script downloads a ZIP archive, extracts its contents, and executes it. The extracted content is the Hijack Loader, which ends up loading the final payload – Lumma stealer.\nMac Machines: A command line is executed, delivering the Atomic Stealer malware.\nMobile Devices: When accessed via your mobile device, the scam will gradually gain access to your Telegram permissions. If detected in time, you should promptly navigate to Telegram’s Settings \u0026gt; Privacy and Security \u0026gt; Active Sessions and select Terminate all other sessions. Additionally, enable or modify your Two-Step Verification settings.\nIOCs # C2 # truecoders[.]cyou byteguard[.]cyou rainstorm[.]cyou codecrafters[.]cyou stem-clasping[.]kliplaxupoi[.]shop 92p1ka158tr2[.]com cloudewahsj[.]shop rabidcowse[.]shop noisycuttej[.]shop latechilderni[.]cyou meow182[.]com Hashes # 4bf9b71414d8b06a02687ebe4caf61ad558bb9c2 44f448e150266cde73808a2b4226314358d4a8f5 c17a7a559a47ab7e835eef840c55c490fdb93729 a3f3d7f6704ccb0d8ba4431ad5f5bfa088c93dbd f34e950726b4a4ba9efcb34e5317971e5a60866b a50f2940e15b68c60d688dd3ce725a6ccf3d0831 dd062bdcb616def4ff69f0e3816eb161fe0f537e ","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fake-safeguard-captchas-on-telegram-hacks-users/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Fake Safeguard Captchas on Telegram Hacks Users","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
